Input: nums = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,3,1]
Explanation: After the first 2 operations, arr1 = [2] and arr2 = [1].
In the 3rd operation, as the last element of arr1 is greater than the last element of arr2 (2 > 1), append nums[3] to arr1.
After 3 operations, arr1 = [2,3] and arr2 = [1].
Hence, the array result formed by concatenation is [2,3,1].
